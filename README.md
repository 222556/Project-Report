**INTERNSHIP REPORT** : After completion of Internship, the student should prepare a comprehensive report to indicate what he has observed and learnt in the training period. The student may contact Industrial Supervisor/ Faculty Mentor /CPDD coordinator for assigning special topics and problems and should prepare the final report on the assigned topics. Daily diary will also help to a great extent in writing the industrial report since much of the information has already been incorporated by the student into the daily diary. The training report should be signed by the Internship Supervisor, CPDD and Faculty Mentor. The Internship report will be evaluated on the basis of following criteria: 

i. Originality. 

ii. Adequacy and purposeful write-up. 

iii. Organization, format, drawings, sketches, style, language etc. 

iv. Variety and relevance of learning experience.  

Practical applications, relationships with basic theory and concepts taught in the course.
